## What is Guimo&trade;?
[Guimo&trade;] is a modular smart toy, created to inspire children to live out-of-this-world experiences! It is a being from another planet, who was on an intergallactic mission when was hit by a meteor and fell on the Earth, losing parts of its pieces, programming and personality. The children's goal is to help [Guimo&trade;] recover its programming and mold its personality, by using our free app on a tablet or compatible smartphone.
